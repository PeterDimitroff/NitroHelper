NitroHelper extension for Chrome.

This extension provides two functionalities that will help with your everyday troubleshooting and working with clients.

1. Start PSI test for the current URL you are on, in a new tab.
2. Open new tab with automatically added "?nonitro", so you can compare optimized and unoptimized versions of the page.


Installation guide can be found in:

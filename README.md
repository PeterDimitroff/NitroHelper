NitroHelper extension for Chrome.

This extension provides two functionalities that will help with your everyday troubleshooting and working with clients.

1. Start PSI test for the current URL you are on, in a new tab.
2. Open new tab with automatically added "?nonitro", so you can compare optimized and unoptimized versions of the page.


Installation guide can be found in:
NitroHelper_installation_guide.pdf


IMPORTANT:
Please note that since this is not official extension release and it cannot be found in the Market - YOU WILL HAVE TO KEEP THE FILES ON YOUR LOCAL DEVICE. If you want it to work ofcourse! :)
